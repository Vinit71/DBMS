  <h2 class="heading-3-i">Introduction:</h2>
  <p class="content1">A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-3">What is Database</h2>
  <p class="content1">The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.</p>
  <p class="content1"><b>For example:</b> The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-4">Advantages of DBMS</h2>
  <ol>
    <li class="list"><b>Better Data Transferring:</b> Database management creates a place where users have an advantage of more and better-managed data. Thus making it possible for end-users to have a quick look and to respond fast to any changes made in their environment.</li>
    <li class="list"><b>Better Data Security:</b> The more accessible and usable the database, the more it is prone to security issues. As the number of users increases, the data transferring or data sharing rate also increases thus increasing the risk of data security. It is widely used in the corporate world where companies invest money, time, and effort in large amounts to ensure data is secure and is used properly. A Database Management System (DBMS) provides a better platform for data privacy and security policies thus, helping companies to improve Data Security.</li>
    <li class="list"><b>Minimized Data Inconsistency:</b> Data inconsistency occurs between files when different versions of the same data appear in different places.</li>
    <li class="list"><b>Data abstraction:</b> The major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the data. Since many complex algorithms are used by the developers to increase the efficiency of databases that are being hidden by the users through various data abstraction levels to allow users to easily interact with the system.</li>
    <li class="list"><b>Reduction in data Redundancy:</b> When working with a structured database, DBMS provides the feature to prevent the input of duplicate items in the database. for e.g. – If there are two same students in different rows, then one of the duplicate data will be deleted.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading-4">Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>
  <ol>
    <li class="list"><b>Cost of hardware and software:</b> This is the first disadvantage of DBMS. This is because to run the DBMS, there is must need for high-speed processors and large memory size. Nowadays, in every field, a large amount of data needs to be stored safely with security. But nowadays, the cost of a high-speed processor and large memory storage is very expensive in hardware and software.</li>
    <li class="list"><b>Frequency Upgrade:</b> we need to stay up-to-date about the latest technologies and developments in the market. The DBMS vendors frequently upgrade the products to add new functionality to the systems. New upgrade versions of the software often come bundled.</li>
    <li class="list"><b>Scalability:</b> The DBMS system may need help to handle increasing database size. In order to understand this, let’s go through an example. Suppose you started a startup a few years back, and the organization has grown significantly. Due to the growth, you would have a larger database in comparison to the early days.</li>
    <li class="list"><b>Huge Size:</b> A database contains a large amount of data, especially for bigger organisations. This data may even increase as more data is updated into the database. All of these leads to a large size of the database. </li>
    <li class="list"><b>Database Failure:</b> All the relevant data for any company is stored in a database. So it is imperative that the database works in optimal condition and there are no failures. A database failure can be catastrophic and can lead to loss or corruption of very important data.</li>
  </ol>

                <p class="content1">Entity Relational model is a model for identifying entities to be represented in the database and representation of how those entities are related. It specifies enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database graphically. </p>
                <h3 class="heading-4">Features of ERM: </h3>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>E-R diagrams are used to represent E-R model in a database, which makes them easy to be converted into relations (tables).</li>
                    <li>E-R diagrams provide the purpose of real-world modeling of objects which makes them intently useful.</li>
                    <li>E-R diagrams require no technical knowledge and no hardware support.</li>
                    <li>These diagrams are very easy to understand and easy to create even by a naive user. </li>

Strong entities are represented by a single rectangle. The relationship of two strong entities is represented by a single diamond. 
                        Various strong entities, when combined together, create a strong entity set. </li>
                    <li class="list"><b>Weak type: </b>A weak entity is dependent on a strong entity to ensure its existence. Unlike a strong entity, a weak entity does not have any primary key. It instead has a partial discriminator key. A weak entity is represented by a double rectangle. </li>

    <h2 class="heading-3">What is PL/SQL</h2>
    <p class="content1">PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic. </p>
<h2 class="heading-4">Features of PL/SQL:</h2>
<ul class="disk-list">
  <li class="pl-list">PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages.</li>
  <li class="pl-list">PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.</li>
  <li class="pl-list">One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications.</li>
  <li class="pl-list">Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is operational.</li>
  <li class="pl-list">PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading-4">Structure of PL/SQL Block:</h2>
<p class="content1">PL/SQL extends SQL by adding constructs found in procedural languages, resulting in a structural language that is more powerful than SQL. The basic unit in PL/SQL is a block. All PL/SQL programs are made up of blocks, which can be nested within each other.</p>
<p class="syntax-pl-structure">
  DECLARE
<br><br>
<span class="pl-structure">declaration statements;</span>
<br><br>
  BEGIN
<br><br>
<span class="pl-structure">executable statements</span>
<br><br>
  EXCEPTIONS
<br><br>
<span class="pl-structure">exception handling statements</span>
<br><br>
  END;
</p>  
<h2 class="heading-4">PL/SQL identifiers:</h2>
<p class="content1">There are several PL/SQL identifiers such as variables, constants, procedures, cursors, triggers etc.</p>
<ul>
<li class="command-desc"><b>Variables: </b>Like several other programming languages, variables in PL/SQL must be declared prior to its use. They should have a valid name and data type as well. Syntax for declaration of variables:</li>
<p class="syntax">variable_name datatype [NOT NULL := value];</p>
<P class="syntax-head">Example:</P>
<img src="img/VAR_PLSQL.png" alt="variable_plsql">

<li class="command-desc"><b>Constants: </b>A constant is a value that remains unchanged throughout the program. It is a user-defined literal value. It can be declared and used instead of actual values.:</li>
<p class="syntax">constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;</p>
<P class="syntax-head">Example:</P>
<img src="img/CONST_PLSQL.png" alt="constant_plsql">

<>
<li class="command-desc"><b>Procedures: </b>A procedure or function is a schema object that logically groups a set of SQL and other PL/SQL programming language statements together to perform a specific task. Procedures and functions are created in a user's schema and stored in a database for continued use.</li>
<p class="syntax">CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name 
  <br>
  [(parameter_name [IN | OUT | IN OUT] type [, ...])] 
  <br>
  {IS | AS}
  <br><br>
  BEGIN 
  <br>
     procedure_body 
     <br> <br>
  END procedure_name;
</p>
<p class="syntax-head"><b>Example: </b></p>
<img src="img/PROCEDURES.png" alt="procedure">

<li class="command-desc"><b>Cursors: </b>To execute SQL statements, a work area is used by the Oracle engine for its internal processing and storing the information. This work area is private to SQL's operations. The 'Cursor' is the PL/SQL construct that allows the user to name the work area and access the stored information in it.</li>
<h2 class="alter">Types of Cursors:</h2>
<p class="content1">Cursors are classified depending on the circumstances in which they are opened.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="decimal-list"><b>Implicit Cursor: </b>If the Oracle engine opened a cursor for its internal processing it is known as an Implicit Cursor. It is created “automatically” for the user by Oracle when a query is executed and is simpler to code.</li>
  <li class="decimal-list"><b>Explicit Cursor: </b>A Cursor can also be opened for processing data through a PL/SQL block, on demand. Such a user-defined cursor is known as an Explicit Cursor.</li>
</ul>
<p class="alter">General syntax for creating a Cursor:</p>

<p class="alter">* Declare a cursor:</p>
<p class="syntax">CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;</p>

<p class="alter">* Open the cursor:</p>
<p class="syntax">OPEN cursor_name;</p>

<p class="alter">* Fetching the cursor:</p>
<p class="syntax">FETCH cursor_name INTO variable_list;</p>

<p class="alter">* Close the cursor:</p>
<p class="syntax">CLOSE cursor_name;</p>

<p class="syntax-head">Complete Cursor syntax:</p>
<p class="syntax">DECLARE variables;
  <br>
  <span class="pl-structure"> records;</span>
  <br>
  <span class="pl-structure">create a cursor;</span>
  <br>
  BEGIN 
  <br>
  <span class="pl-structure">OPEN cursor;</span>
  <br> 
  <span class="pl-structure">FETCH cursor;</span>
  <br>
  <span class="pl-structure">process the records;</span>
  <br>
  <span class="pl-structure">CLOSE cursor;</span>
  <br> 
  END;
</p>

<li class="command-desc"><b>Triggers: </b>Triggers are stored programs, which are automatically executed or fired when some event occurs. It could be defined on the table, view, schema, or database with which the event is associated.</li>
<h3 class="heading-4">Advantages of Triggers</h3>
  <ol>
    <li class="list">Trigger generates some derived column values automatically.</li>
    <li class="list">Enforces referential integrity</li>
    <li class="list">Event logging and storing information on table access</li>
